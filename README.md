# svelte-app electron edition!

This is a project template for [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). It lives at https://github.com/lpshanley/svelte-app-electron.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit lpshanley/svelte-app-electron svelte-app-electron
cd svelte-app-electron
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app-electron
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

An Electron window will open automaticaly. You should now seel your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the app should update automatically with your changes.

## Building you app

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can get the newly built app in the `dist` folder.
